# OpenFilamentDryer

//This is my inital brain storm.


## Goals
### Cheap
- Including over the long term so efficency needs to balance with initial cost
- long service life is a must so that it does not need to be made again
- investigate ways of using existing appliaces someone might have
### Automatic
- May help keep electric bills down if we can not overdry the filament or dry fillment that doesnt need it
### Nice
-USB C Power Delivery
-long service life
-supports companies that supports the maker community so lets try to use the RP2040

### Power Efficient via insulation
